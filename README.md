## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data. Using Excel for data cleaning and visualization, the goal is to uncover trends, demographic insights, and customer behaviors influencing bike purchasing decisions.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Processed raw data to address missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate entries.
   - Added an **Age Brackets** feature to categorize customers as _Adolescent_, _Middle Age_, and _Old_.

2. **Data Insights (via Pivot Tables)**:
   - **Income Analysis**: Compared average income between genders for purchasing trends.
   - **Distance Analysis**: Examined relationships between commute distance and purchase likelihood.
   - **Age Analysis**: Determined purchasing patterns across different age brackets.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Visualizations highlighting key insights such as purchase counts by age, gender, and commute distance.
   - Dynamic slicers for users to explore specific data dimensions.

## Key Insights
- **Income Effect**:
  - Males with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bikes.
  - Females with an average income of â‚¹55,774 displayed a comparable purchase frequency.
  
- **Commute Distance**:
  - Most buyers lived within **0-1 miles** of the bike shop.
  
- **Age Patterns**:
  - Middle-aged individuals formed the majority of buyers (~76%), followed by adolescents and older individuals.
